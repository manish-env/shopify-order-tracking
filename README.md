## üìä Order Status Logic

The API determines order status based on the following rules:

1. **"Order Processing"**: 
   - Order is less than 48 hours old
   - No tracking number has been added yet
   - Order is still being prepared for shipment

2. **"In Transit"**: 
   - Order is older than 48 hours OR tracking number has been added
   - Shows tracking number when available
   - Order is being shipped to customer

3. **"Order Delivered"**: 
   - Order has been marked as delivered in Shopify (closed_at is set)
   - Final status indicating successful delivery

**Status Flow:**
```
Order Placed ‚Üí Order Processing (0-48h) ‚Üí In Transit ‚Üí Order Delivered
```

**Response includes:**
- `status`: Current order status
- `trackingNumber`: Tracking number (if available)
- `orderDate`: When order was placed
- `deliveredAt`: Delivery date (if delivered)
- `lastUpdated`: API response timestamp
